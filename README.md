# To-Do List App

## About the Project

The To-Do List App is a simple React-based application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This project was created as a practice for learning React concepts, including state management, component architecture, and styling with CSS.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can input tasks and add them to the list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Modify existing tasks with an easy-to-use edit feature.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Toggle tasks between completed and incomplete states.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Completed tasks are visually distinct with a line-through effect.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Styling:** CSS (with custom and reusable styles)
- **Icons:** Font Awesome

## How It Works

1. Users can add a new task by typing in the input field and clicking the "GÃ¶rev Ekle" button.
2. Tasks appear in a list format with options to:
   - **Edit:** Update the task's text.
   - **Delete:** Remove the task from the list.
   - **Mark as Completed:** Change the task's state to completed or incomplete.
3. Tasks are styled dynamically based on their completion state.
